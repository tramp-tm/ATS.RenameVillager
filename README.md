# Against The Storm Mod. Rename villagers

This is a based on [template](https://github.com/ats-mods/ModTemplate) for an Against the Storm mod. Many Thanks to `ats-mods` and [Josiwe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1b3lOKZIcw).

The compiled mod is meant to be loaded into the game with [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx). 

The `.dll` file created by this mod can then be dropped into the `BepInEx\plugins` subdirectory inside the game directory.
